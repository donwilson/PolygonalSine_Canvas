HTML5 Canvas-based "Polygonal Sine"
===================================

Inspired by [1ucasvb][1]'s ["polygonal sine" gif][2].

All wave points are calculated and stored into an array before the animation even starts, removing the need for calculations on every frame. No third-party JavaSscript library is utilized.

I've tried to keep the colors, dimensions, and animation speed to that of the original GIF; the frame rate is much higher than the original GIF, producing a far smoother animation.

A [Live Demo][3] is available.
